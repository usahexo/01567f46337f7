The game of keno originated in China and it is still played in many parts of Asia. Caveman Keno is a newer variation of the game that was introduced in the United States in the early 2000s. Let’s take a look at the differences between these two versions of Keno and see which one offers better odds for winning money.</p>
<p>The basic premise of both games is the same, but there are some important differences. In Caveman Keno, players can win if they match just two out of the four corners of their ticket, while in traditional Keno, players must match three out of six spots to win. This makes Caveman Keno much easier to win than traditional Keno, so your chances of winning money are higher with Caveman Keno.</p>
<p>Another difference between the two games is that in traditional Keno, you can only bet on a certain number of spots at a time. With Caveman Keno, you can bet on as many or as few spots as you like, which gives you more flexibility when betting.</p>
<p>Overall, Caveman Keno offers better odds for winning money than traditional Keno. If you want to increase your chances of winning at slots, then I recommend playing Caveman Keno instead of traditional Keno.</p>

However, there are some key differences between the two that you should be aware of before playing. In this article, we will take a look at the tips you can use to improve your chances of winning when playing Caveman Keno.</p>
<p>When playing Caveman Keno, it is important to remember that the odds of winning are not as good as they are when playing regular Keno. This is because there are fewer numbers to choose from, which means that the odds of matching all of them are lower. However, if you follow some simple tips, you can improve your chances of winning:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Firstly, always choose the maximum number of tickets you can afford to play. The more tickets you play, the better your chances of winning will be.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Secondly, always try to pick numbers that have been drawn previously less often. This will increase your chances of winning a prize.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Thirdly, make sure you keep track of how many numbers you have matched so far. This will help you determine which numbers to keep betting on and which to discard.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Following these tips will help increase your chances of winning when playing Caveman Keno. Good luck!</p>
<h1 id="Keno-vs-Caveman-Keno-Playing-to-Win"><a href="#Keno-vs-Caveman-Keno-Playing-to-Win" class="headerlink" title="Keno vs Caveman Keno: Playing to Win"></a>Keno vs Caveman Keno: Playing to Win</h1><p>Would you rather play caveman keno or traditional keno? The answer to this question largely depends on your personal gaming strategy. If you’re looking to minimize your risk and want a game that’s more akin to bingo, then caveman keno is the way to go. However, if you’re looking for a game that has potentially higher payouts, then traditional keno is the better option.</p>
<p>When playing caveman keno, all you need to do is match as many numbers as possible on your keno ticket to the numbers that are called out. In order to win, you only have to match two numbers or more. This makes the game much easier than traditional keno, where you need to match at least three numbers in order to win a prize. As a result, the odds of winning with caveman keno are much higher than with traditional keno.</p>
<p>However, because the payouts for caveman keno are generally lower than those for traditional keno, it’s important to make sure that you’re playing at a casino that offers good odds. In general, stick with casinos that have a payout percentage of 95% or higher. That way, you can be sure that you’ll get back most of your money – even if you don’t win the jackpot.</p>

Keno or Caveman Keno?"></a>Which Game is Better for You When it Comes to Winning Money? Keno or Caveman Keno?</h1><p>When it comes to online casino games, there are a few different types that you can choose from. If you want to win some money, then you might be wondering which game you should play. In this article, we will compare Keno and Caveman Keno to help you decide which game is better for you.</p>
<p>Keno is a lottery-style game that is played with numbered balls. You select a set of numbers and then watch as the balls are drawn one by one. If your numbers match those that are drawn, then you win the corresponding prize.</p>
<p>Caveman Keno is very similar to Keno, but it has a few added bonus rounds that can give you the chance to win even more money. In Caveman Keno, you can also earn extra lives so that you can keep playing if you lose all your money. This can be a great advantage if you are trying to win big at the casino.</p>
<p>So, which game is better for you? Well, it really depends on what you are looking for in an online casino game. If you want a simple game that is easy to play, then Keno might be the better option for you. However, if you want more excitement and bonus rounds, then Caveman Keno is definitely the way to go.</p>

There are two main types of keno: Keno and Caveman Keno. They are both essentially the same game but with different payouts and odds.</p>
<p>In Keno, players choose up to 20 numbers and then wait for the drawn balls to match their numbers. If a player matches all 20 numbers, they win the jackpot. There are also smaller prizes for matching anywhere from 2 to 10 numbers. In Caveman Keno, players can only pick 10 numbers and there are no prizes for matching less than all 10 numbers. The payout percentages and odds are also slightly different between the two types of keno.</p>
<p>For most people, Caveman Keno is the better option because it has better payouts and odds. However, if you like to play with a lot of different numbers, then Keno may be a better option for you.</p>
