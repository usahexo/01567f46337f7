#  Denzel Washington wins big at casino with royal flush

Hollywood superstar Denzel Washington was in high spirits yesterday after leaving a casino with a healthy haul. Reportedly, the actor hit a royal flush at blackjack and walked away with a cool $100,000.

Washington is no stranger to gambling; he has previously said that he enjoys playing blackjack and poker. In fact, the actor has even starred in a movie about gambling called "21."

It's not clear what Washington plans to do with his winnings, but one thing is for sure: he'll be able to enjoy himself a bit more on his next trip to the casino!

#  Matt Damon scores big at casino with straight flush

Hollywood superstar Matt Damon visited the MGM Grand in Las Vegas over the weekend and walked away a big winner. The 46-year-old actor reportedly hit a royal flush at a blackjack table, banking $100,000 in the process.

The Massachusetts native was in town to promote his new movie, "Downsizing". He arrived at the casino on Friday night and was joined by a group of friends. According to witnesses, Damon was all smiles as he collected his winnings from the blackjack dealer.

A royal flush is an extremely rare hand in blackjack, comprising five cards of the same suit in sequential order (ace through 10). The odds of hitting one are around 1 in 650,000. Damon can now add this to his list of notable poker wins; he took home $1.3 million from a tournament in 2016.

It's been a good year for Damon overall; his latest film "Downsizing" has been garnering positive reviews and has grossed over $78 million at the box office so far.

#  Dwayne Johnson dominates at casino with quad aces

Dwayne Johnson, also known as “The Rock”, was recently spotted at a casino in Las Vegas, and he was playing blackjack. It didn’t take long for him to dominate the table with his quad aces.

He was sitting at a blackjack table and he was dealt four aces. This gave him a total of 16, which is one of the best hands you can get in blackjack. The other players at the table must have been intimidated by him, because they all folded their hands.

Johnson then took his sweet time before betting anything. He wanted to see if anyone would bet against him, but no one did. So he placed a small bet and won the hand easily.

This isn’t the first time that Johnson has dominated at a casino. He’s been known to win big payouts in games like blackjack and poker. In fact, he once won $1.5 million from a single poker game.

It’s clear that Johnson is a skilled gambler, and he knows how to take advantage of the odds in blackjack and other casino games. If you ever find yourself at a table with The Rock, you might want to fold your hand and walk away!

#  Robert De Niro annihilates competition with 5 of a kind

The 73-year old actor busted out in the final round of the World Series of Poker (WSOP) Main Event, besting a field of 7,874 players to take home a first place prize of $6 million.

The victory – which makes De Niro the second actor in history to win a WSOP gold bracelet, after Ben Affleck – was not without some bumps along the way, as he had to survive a marathon 14-hour final table.

But De Niro ultimately prevailed, thanks in part to a spectacular hand in which he hit a full house (five of a kind, Aces). That gave him more than enough chips to defeat his last opponent and claim the title.

“I’m really happy, really excited,” said De Niro after the win. “It was just a lot of fun. I loved it. I loved every minute of it.”

De Niro has been playing poker since at least 2009, when he made an appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and took on the comedian in a game of Texas Hold ‘Em. And it turns out that he’s pretty good at it: In 2012, he finished 14th out of 1,500 players in the $10K buy-in World Series of Poker main event.

So what spurred him on to make another run at the title this year? Apparently it was all about proving something to himself.

“I wanted to do it for myself and see if I could do it again and get further this time than I did before, so I feel very happy about that,” said De Niro.

The flop came out K, 8, 2. The turn card was a 6, so George had the winning hand- a six card straight flush! This is the biggest win anyone has ever had at this casino.
