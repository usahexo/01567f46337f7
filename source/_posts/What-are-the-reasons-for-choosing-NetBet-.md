#  What is the secret to Heysen's success? 

In the early 1900s, Australian artist Hans Heysen was considered one of the most promising painters in the country. However, he mysteriously stopped producing art in the late 1930s and his work was largely forgotten. In recent years, there's been a resurgence of interest in Heysen's work and many have asked: what is the secret to his success? 

There's no one answer to that question, but there are a few things that contributed to Heysen's success as an artist. Firstly, he had a strong passion for art and was driven to create something beautiful. He also had a great sense of discipline and worked extremely hard to improve his skills. And finally, he was able to develop his own unique style which set him apart from other artists. 

Heysen was born in 1877 in what is now South Australia. When he was just 14 years old, he started taking art classes at the Royal Adelaide Hospital where he learnt about the principles of drawing and composition. A few years later, he moved to London to study at the Slade School of Fine Art. On his return to Australia in 1902, Heysen began exhibiting his work and quickly gained recognition as a talented young artist. 

Throughout his career, Heysen continued to paint landscapes, still lifes and portraits – often capturing the natural beauty of his homeland. In 1937, at the age of 60, Heysen suddenly stopped painting and didn't resume until the late 1950s. By that time, his work had become increasingly popular and he was hailed as one of Australia's most important artists. 

Heysen passed away in 1981 at the age of 104, but his legacy lives on through his paintings which remain some of Australia's most prized artworks.

#  How did Golden State Warriors and Heysen become partners? 

Way back in the 2014-2015 NBA season, the Golden State Warriors were looking for a new jersey sponsor. At the time, Heysen was a relatively small company with only about 60 employees. In comparison, some of the other potential sponsors for the Warriors’ jersey were companies like Farmers Insurance and Comcast.

So how did the small company end up winning the sponsorship deal? It all came down to Heysen’s CEO and founder, Bjorn Reynolds. Bjorn is an avid basketball fan and he was determined to make a deal with the Warriors. He flew out to California and met with the team’s executives himself. He pitched them his idea and convinced them that Heysen was the perfect partner for the team.

The Warriors liked what they heard and decided to give Heysen a chance. The two companies have been working together ever since. Heysen has appeared on the Warriors’ jerseys and also sponsors their practice facilities.
