"This is what I play for," said Leonard after the game. "This is why I'm in this league."

Other members of the Raptors celebrated their big win as well. "I've been waiting for this my whole life," said Serge Ibaka, who contributed 14 points and 12 rebounds off the bench. "I'm so happy for our team, our city."

The Warriors had high praise for Leonard as well. "He's a superstar," said Steph Curry. "He deserves all of the credit."

#  Middleton, Antetokounmpo lead Bucks to blackjack payout over Boston Celtics 

In a matchup of Eastern Conference contenders,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/), the Milwaukee Bucks (37-29) got the best of the Boston Celtics (41-25) behind big games from their All-Stars Khris Middleton and Giannis Antetokounmpo.

The Bucks led wire-to-wire, largely thanks to an impressive performance on the offensive end. They shot 54% from the field and 42% from three, while also averaging 1.27 points per possession. Middleton led the way with 27 points on 10-of-17 shooting, while Antetokounmpo added 24 points and 12 rebounds.

Boston was competitive for most of the game but couldn’t keep up with Milwaukee’s firepower. Kyrie Irving led the Celtics with 32 points, but no other player managed more than 14. The Celtics shot just 41% from the field and only 29% from three, which ultimately doomed them in this matchup.

The win moves Milwaukee into third place in the East, while Boston falls to fourth. These teams could meet again in the playoffs later this season, and Wednesday’s game should give both squads a good idea of what they need to work on ahead of that potential matchup.

#  LeBron James Leads Lakers to blackjack payout Victory Over Rockets 

The Lakers came into Tuesday night’s matchup against the Rockets looking to erase the memory of their embarrassing home loss to the Pelicans over the weekend. LeBron James led the way with 29 points, 10 rebounds and six assists as they ran out 109-105 winners in Houston.

Rockets fans were optimistic of a victory before tip-off, given that James Harden was out with a hamstring injury. However, James was simply too much for Chris Paul and company on this night, as he hit some clutch shots down the stretch to seal the win.

It was also a good team effort from the Lakers, who had six players score in double figures. Brandon Ingram scored 21 points, Kyle Kuzma added 20 and Josh Hart chipped in with 18 off the bench.

With the victory, Los Angeles improve to 8-7 on the season while the Rockets fall to 11-4.

#  Kyrie Irving Leads Celtics to blackjack payout Victory Over Raptors 

The Celtics started their preseason matchups with a victory over the Raptors. Kyrie Irving led the way with 21 points and 8 assists in just 24 minutes of play. Jayson Tatum chipped in 20 points, while Gordon Hayward added 16. The Celtics were able to win 97-93, despite a late Raptors rally. 

"We executed well tonight," Irving said after the game. "Even when they made their run, we were still able to stick to our game plan and get the win." 

Irving was especially impressive in the first half, scoring 17 points on 7-of-8 shooting. He was equally adept at getting his teammates involved, as he racked up 5 assists before halftime. 

"Kyrie was terrific," Boston head coach Brad Stevens said. "He was aggressive and created for other people." 

Tatum continued his strong preseason play, knocking down several mid-range jumpers en route to a 20-point night. He also showed off his defensive prowess, recording 3 blocks and 3 steals. Hayward looked comfortable playing alongside Irving and Tatum, hitting several contested shots late in the game. 

Marcus Morris led the bench effort with 14 points off the pine. Rookie Robert Williams had a strong debut as well, scoring 10 points and grabbing 8 rebounds in just 18 minutes of action. Terry Rozier also played well, tallying 9 points and 5 assists in 26 minutes of play. 

Although it was only preseason, winning against a good Raptors team is a positive sign for the Celtics. Kyrie Irving looks locked in and ready for another playoff run, while Jayson Tatum continues to develop into one of the league's best young players. The Celtics should be one of the top teams in the East this season - look out for them come playoff time!

#  Houston Rockets take down Golden State Warriors in blackjack payout

Houston Rockets -115
Golden State Warriors -105

In a matchup that had the potential to be one of the most exciting games of the season, the Houston Rockets took down the Golden State Warriors 122-121 in what can only be described as an upset.

The Rockets were led by James Harden who had 38 points on the night, while Klay Thompson led Golden State with 31. Thompson had a chance to win the game for Golden State with a three pointer as time expired, but his shot rimmed out and handed the victory to Houston.

The Rockets were able to win thanks in part to a blackjack payout on their last bet of the game. With the Warriors leading 121-120, Houston put their final bet of $10 on blackjack, which paid out at 3-1 odds. That gave them the margin they needed to pull out the victory.

While some may call it luck, the Rockets have now won four of their last five games and appear to be heating up at just the right time. With Harden playing at an MVP level and Chris Paul healthy again, they could be a tough team to beat in the playoffs.
