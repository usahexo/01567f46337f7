#  How Super Roulette Works – and How to Win at It!

If you enjoy playing roulette, but want to give yourself a better chance of winning, then you may be wondering if Super Roulette is worth playing.

This variant of the game is played on a slightly different table, with just two betting areas: outside and inside. There are also just 12 numbers on the wheel, compared to the standard 36.

The aim of the game is still to correctly predict which number the ball will land on, but because there are less numbers, your chances of winning are improved.

There are a number of strategies that you can use when playing Super Roulette in order to increase your chances of winning. One popular strategy is called the D’Alembert System.

The D’Alembert System is a simple progressive betting system that can be used with any type of bet. It works by increasing your bet by one unit after every loss, and reducing it by one unit after every win.

For example, if you start with a bet of €1 and lose, you would then bets €2 on the next spin. If you then win, your next bet would be €1 again. If you continue to follow this system over time, you will eventually break even.

Another strategy that can be used when playing Super Roulette is the Martingale System. This system is also a progressive betting system, but it works in reverse – instead of increasing your bet after a loss, you decrease it after each win.

For example, if you start with a bet of €1 and win, your next bet would be €0.50. If you then lose, your next bet would be €1 again. As with the D’Alembert System, if you continue to follow this system over time, you will eventually break even.

Whichever betting system you choose to use when playing Super Roulette, always remember to set yourself limits and only bet what you can afford to lose.

#  Why Is Super Roulette So Popular?

Super Roulette is one of the most popular variants of online roulette and for good reason – it offers players some of the best odds around! In this article, we’ll take a look at why Super Roulette is so popular and what makes it stand out from the crowd.

The first thing to note about Super Roulette is that it offers a much higher return to player (RTP) than other variants of roulette. In fact, the RTP for Super Roulette can be as high as 98%, which is significantly higher than the RTP for American Roulette (96.3%) or European Roulette (97.3%). This means that players have a better chance of winning when playing Super Roulette, which is obviously a major draw card for many players.

Another thing that makes Super Roulette stand out from the crowd is that it features an extra betting option known as Neighbours. This allows players to bet on a selection of numbers that are adjacent to each other on the roulette wheel, which can result in some big payouts if successful.

Overall, Super Roulette is one of the most popular variants of online roulette for good reason – its high RTP and extra betting option make it a great choice for players looking to win big!

#  How Does the New Super Roulette System Work?

The new Super Roulette system is a spin on an old classic. It's been designed to make your playing experience more advantageous, while still providing all of the thrills and excitement of traditional roulette.

How does it work?

The Super Roulette system works by taking advantage of the sequence of numbers that are generated when the wheel is spun. It assigns a different value to each number, which is then used to calculate the payout percentage for each bet.

What are the benefits?

The Super Roulette system offers a number of benefits over traditional roulette, including:

- Higher payouts - The payout percentage for each bet is significantly higher than in traditional roulette, meaning you can make more money with each spin.

- Increased chances of winning - The odds of winning are much higher with this system than with traditional roulette, giving you a better chance of coming out ahead.

- Enhanced excitement - The Super Roulette system provides all the excitement and thrill of traditional roulette, without the downside of having lower payouts.

#  Play Like a Pro: Tips for Winning at Super Roulette

Roulette is a classic casino game that’s been around for centuries. The object of the game is to guess where the ball will land on the spinning wheel. There are a number of betting options available, and the player can win money by predicting the correct outcome.

Super Roulette is a variant of the traditional game that offers players even more chances to win. This guide will teach you how to play Super Roulette like a pro and maximise your chances of winning big!

# Understanding the Rules

The first step to playing Super Roulette like a pro is understanding the basic rules of the game. In Super Roulette, there are 37 numbered slots on the wheel, plus a 0 and a 00 slot. Players can bet on any one of these numbers, or on combinations of numbers.

The bet covers a selection of 12 consecutive numbers from the chosen number. For example, if you bet on 12, your bet would cover numbers from 12-23 inclusive. The payout for this particular bet depends on the odds offered by the casino.

# Betting Strategies

There are a number of different betting strategies that you can use when playing Super Roulette. Here are some of our favourites:

Martingale System: This system is based on doubling your bets after every loss until you eventually win. It can be risky, but it also has the potential to earn big payouts if used correctly.

paroli System: This system involves increasing your bets after every win until you eventually lose. It’s less risky than Martingale, and it can be a more profitable way to play if you have good luck!

D’Alembert System: The D’Alembert system is a conservative betting strategy that involves maintaining your initial stakes regardless of whether you win or lose. It’s less risky than some other systems, but it can be less profitable in the long run.

#  Get the Edge at Super Roulette: Strategies That Work

When you walk into a casino, the roulette tables are usually front and center, beckoning you to try your luck. The spinning wheel and the clicking of the ball make a casino classic that’s hard to resist, but if you want to beat the house, you need to know what you’re doing.

There are all sorts of strategies out there for playing roulette – some work better than others. Here are a few of our favorites:

1. The Martingale System

The Martingale system is one of the most popular strategies for playing roulette. It’s simple – you just double your bet after every loss until you win. This system is based on the idea that eventually, you’re going to win and recoup all of your losses plus some extra profit.

While it can be tempting to use this system when you’re down, it’s important to remember that it can also lead to big losses very quickly if things go wrong. And even if it does work in the short-term, the casino has an edge over players in the long run, so you won’t be able to keep betting this way forever!

2. The D’Alembert System

If you want a slightly safer alternative to the Martingale system, try using the D’Alembert system instead. This strategy is similar – you increase your bet by one unit after each loss, but once you win a bet, your bet size goes back down to its original amount.

This system is a little less risky than doubling your bets after every loss, but it still has its drawbacks – namely that you can lose a lot of money if your bets keep coming up short. So if you choose to use this strategy, make sure that you have plenty of money set aside to cover potential losses!


3. The Parlay System

If safety isn’t your concern and you feel lucky enough to double up your bets after every loss, try using the Parlay system instead! This strategy works by increasing your bet size after every win as well – but in this case, instead of resetting back to your original bet amount after each loss like with the D’Alembert system, you continue doubling your bet size with each successive win.


This can lead to some big payouts if everything goes as planned, but it also carries a lot more risk than either of the other systems we’ve mentioned so far. So only use this strategy if you feel confident in your ability to win consistently at roulette!
