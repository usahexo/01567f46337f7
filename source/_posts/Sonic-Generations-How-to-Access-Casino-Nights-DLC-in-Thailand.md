#  Sonic Generations How to Access Casino Nights DLC in Thailand

 Sonic Generations, the game that celebrates Sonic's 20th Anniversary, was released on the PC, Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and Nintendo 3DS on November 1st. It has been generally well-received by gamers and achieved high scores from many reviewers. One of the bonuses included in Sonic Generations is access to Casino Nights DLC (downloadable content) for Thailand only.

Some people may find this confusing, as there is no mention of Thailand DLC in the game's official description or manual. Even stranger still, it is not simply a matter of downloading an update; you must take specific steps in order to access it. 

The process for unlocking the Casino Night DLC for Thailand is as follows: 

1. Locate the file 'th_dlc' within your Sonic Generations installation folder. This file is buried deep within the game's files, so you may have to do some searching to find it. 
2. Once you've found th_dlc, rename it to 'dlc'. This will make it easier to locate later on. 
3. Copy the file 'dlc' into your Steamapps\common\sonicgenerations\ directory. If asked to overwrite any files, click Yes to all. 
4. Open up Steam and start Sonic Generations. If everything has been set up correctly, you should now see a new icon entitled 'Thailand Casino Nights' in your DLC menu!

You will require a few things before you can start playing Sonic Generations Casino Nights DLC in Thailand. The first is a Sega Genesis or Mega Drive console. These can be found for purchase on websites such as eBay or through local classified ads. The second is a copy of the Sonic Generations game. This can also be found relatively easily online or at your favorite gaming store. The third, and final, item you will need is a Thai Game Racer 3 (TG3) card. These cards are available to purchase at most electronics stores in Thailand and cost between ฿200-300 (approximately $6-10 USD).

Once you have collected all of the necessary items, it’s time to begin the process of setting everything up. The first step is to connect your Sega Genesis console to your television using the appropriate cables. Once connected, turn on your console and insert Sonic Generations into the cartridge slot. Next, insert your TG3 card into one of the console’s controllers. Finally, power on your television and wait for the Sega Genesis logo to appear.

Now that everything is set up and ready to go, you can begin playing Sonic Generations Casino Nights DLC in Thailand! To do this, select “Casino Night Zone” from the main menu then choose “Single Player” mode. You will now be taken to a new screen with four different game options: Play Game, Options, Training, and High Scores. Choose “Play Game” and you will be taken to another menu with three different game options: 1P Playthrough, 2P Playthrough, and Time Attack Mode. Choose whichever option you would like to play and get ready for some casino fun!

#  Sonic Generations Unlocked: Get the Casino Nights DLC in Thailand

Sonic Generations is an interesting game. As a huge fan of the blue blur, I was excited when I first heard about it. It had potential to revive Sonic’s flagging fortunes and give longtime fans the nostalgic experience they craved. In many ways, it succeeds; but there are some areas where it falls short.

One of the main problems with Sonic Generations is its inconsistency. Sometimes it nails that classic Sonic feel, while other times it just feels like a mediocre platformer. This inconsistency also extends to the level design – some levels are fantastic while others are just plain frustrating.

The Casino Nights DLC pack probably won’t do much to address these issues, but it’s still a lot of fun. It contains three new levels – “Casino Forest,” “The Cages” and “Frontier Valley” – as well as a new boss fight and unlockable character. The levels are all well designed and offer a fun challenge; and the new boss fight is inventive and enjoyable. Overall, the Casino Nights DLC pack is great addition to Sonic Generations and well worth buying if you’re a fan of the game.
